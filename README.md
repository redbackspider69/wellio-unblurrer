# wellio-unblurrer
Userscript which unblurs all locked questions in a Wellio quiz, so one may do them before their peasantly friends are able to. <br>
However, one will only be able to submit them successfully once they are actually unlocked.

## Usage

1. [Get Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/),  or equivalent userscript manager.
2. Install the userscript from Greasyfork: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/538501-wellio-locked-question-unblurrer
3. The userscript will automatically unblur locked questions, and can be toggled in your userscript manager.

## Issues?

If it appears the userscript isn't working, double check you have properly installed it and it is enabled in your userscript manager.

Otherwise, please [open an issue](https://github.com/redbackspider69/wellio-unblurrer/issues/new), describe your problem and upload a screenshot of the tab with the console open:
1. Press F12 on the Wellio page where it is not working.
2. Go to the "Console" section, and take a screenshot, capturing the window.
3. Attach it in the issue.
